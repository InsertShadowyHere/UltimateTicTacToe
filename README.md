Fully functional Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe! Just boot up Python, run pip install pygame, and then run game.py.

Rules:
Each smaller board functions as an individual tic-tac-toe board, but there's a twist.
Whatever square you play in, in the smaller board, is the board your opponent has to play in next turn.
So if I play in the bottom-left square of the middle on my turn, my opponent has to play in the bottom-left board.
If you get 3-in-a-row in a board, you win that board.
If anyone tries to force you into a board that's already either won or tied, you can play anywhere.
