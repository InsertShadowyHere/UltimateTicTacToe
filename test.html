        Hi! Welcome to Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe. This is the first website I've ever made, so hopefully
        it's only up from here. Enjoy the game, and feel free to check out some of my other stuff.
        :)

        <strong>How To Play</strong><br>
        The objective of the game is to score three small boards in a row (so, like a normal game of Tic-Tac-Toe).
        Each of those small boards must be won themselves.<br>
        The trick comes down to placement. You can only place an X or O in the 
        board that corresponds to your opponent's last square.<br>
        For example, if I played in the top right square of my board,
        you'd only be able to play in the top right board.<br>
        If you're forced into a board that's already been won, or one that's full,
        you can play wherever you want.
